Iron sharpen Iron
Ignore insult
Cover inperfection
Please walk beside me so we can see throught and work together
Patient is the key to success
Be humble
Be kind
Gives you get something back
Always take a good thing in any case
Silent is golden
You can't change the pass but you can plan your future
Success is maeasured by others but happiness by your own

Iron sharpen Iron
Ignore insult
Cover inperfection
Please walk beside me so we can see throught and work together
Patient is the key to success
Be humble
Be kind * 3
Gives you get something back
Always take a good thing in any case
Silent is golden
You can't change the pass but you can plan your future
Success is maeasured by others but happiness by your own
To control your temper is better than to gain the whole city
Search for opportunity
Understanding and respact others
In Life is not the matter how good you are, but how good you are for others.
Be modest
Keep learning
Use what you have, do not count to what you have lost.
Be honest
Admitted if you done wrong
Kindness is something that can be heard by the deaf and seen by the blind.
Look at to the future, forget the pass
